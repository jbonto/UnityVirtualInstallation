# UnityVirtualInstallation
A Unity projects with very basic scripts, meant to be used to create virtual installations.

It sais horror installation hear and there, because that was the original name of the horror file.  I changed it afterwords in virtual installation because that is more fitting.
For sound crediting, song CT-01 was made by myself in Garageband as a placeholder song for a project I was working on at the time, and the thunder sound effect was found on soundbible.com
